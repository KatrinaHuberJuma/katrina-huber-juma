            <p>I’ve always loved creating. I realize now that everything I’ve created has been helping me to discover myself as an engineer.</p>

            <p>I started my career after college as a self-taught graphic designer for a tech startup. One thing this taught me was to never keep my work secret out of fear of embarrassment. I learned to share earlier versions of my designs, testing them against the client’s wishes. Later, I would recognize this collaborative and iterative approach in discussions of software development.</p>

            <p>Eventually, I decided to transition into web design. I was surprised to discover that I was consistently more interested in development than design. I began diving deeper into JavaScript. I found it extremely pleasing to create websites that “do stuff.” But ultimately, I was not satisfied because the user experience felt so ephemeral. I wanted to make something that would persist changes.</p> 

            <p>And then I decided to go all in and attend Hackbright Academy to learn full stack. Working on my solo project, I finally started to feel that I was on the right track. I got a lot of joy from imagining users navigating through my application, making use of it and returning to it. </p>

            <p>I can, at last, make things that feel meaningful to me. I am eager to find a job that will put my skills to use and that will give me a chance to pick up new skills as needed. In the meantime, I will never stop creating.</p>

                <p>Pair Necessities is designed to help students keep track of their class labs. Users can tag a lab with keywords. Users can browse keywords to find related labs. A student can see who they paired with for that lab, and be able to edit notes shared with their pair. Administrators can manage cohorts, labs and lab pairings. </p> 
                <p>I used PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Python, Unittest, Flask, Jinja, Selenium, JavaScript and JQuery

                <p>Skills App will be a relational database managing my acquired skills and projects. I will be able to sign in to add a skill and/or a project. Other users will be able to see all my skills and what projects they were used in, search my projects by skills used, and see details about where and how each skill came into play in a project. </p> 
                <p>I intend to use MySQL, Node, Express, and Angular
