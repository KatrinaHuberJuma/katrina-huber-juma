    <p>I started my career after college as a self-taught graphic designer for a tech startup. Initially, I had an impulse to keep my designs secret until they were “perfect.” I soon realized that resulted in wasting time on designs that would not pan out. So, I started sharing earlier versions. Later, I would recognize this collaborative and iterative approach in discussions of software development.</p>

    <p>Eventually, I decided to transition into web design. That didn’t exactly work out how I planned though; I became more interested in development than design. I began diving deeper into JavaScript. I found it extremely pleasing to create websites that “do stuff.” But ultimately, I was not satisfied because the user experience felt so ephemeral. I wanted to make something that would persist changes.</p> 

    <p>And then I decided to go all in and attend Hackbright Academy to learn full stack. Working on my solo project, I finally started to feel that I was on the right track. I got a lot of joy from imagining users navigating through my application, making use of it and returning to it. </p>

    <p>I can, at last, make things that feel meaningful to me. I am eager to find a job that will put my skills to use and that will give me a chance to pick up new skills as needed. In the meantime, I will never stop creating.</p></div>
